What should the sharableURL file do?

1. Strip the URL for an id attribute
    - - export the estimateExists varaible to index.js
2. If ID exists
    - go do a GET statement from the database and get the record
    - also GET the identifier to update the URL field once again (or) save the URL along with the other data 
    - also GET hs_id so that we can update values incase they change
    - do not create a HS record
    - do not create a new dB record
    - 
3. With the retrieved values then fill in the input fields
4. Click the continue buttons at each stage
    - this will trigger the respective functions for each stage in the index.js file
    - do not create a new HS record
5. Click the fourth submit button after that. 

The (fouth-continue-button).onClick function on the sharableURL.js file getting triggered
before the index.js files function is getting triggered. 




You want to update the select field. By default three values exist, what if they didn't exist and you added options only after reading the sumInsured values?

Method 1: Add the options through code.
- Spot input fields relevant to each product and save it in a variable 
- Iterate through the JSON of the product and get the sumInsured's and add it to the SELECT field
- Do Object.keys(option).forEach((ele)=>{console.log(option[ele].value)}) and check if the current value exists 
- Depending on that, add or skip. 
- Loop through entire products variable and do this for every product


What needs to be done once we have the product?
- Choose product[1]
- inside that we have fundingJSON which is an array of array's
- iterate through fundingJSON and each array in it to get the SI's

- you can get SELECT fields based on data-attribute of product name
    - so looping through the products and for every product name we will search for it's respective SELECT field and add the options WITHOUT duplicates.
    - so create an array and add the SI into the array only if it doesn't exist in the array. 





How to show options based on the available SI's for a praticular product?
- For each industry, each product has it's own SI 
- We will need to read the Json for each product, get the SI, 

- Get the SELECT field, store in an ID. 
- ID.options gives you an object with each option
    - forEach of ID.options 
        - if (fundingJSON.find(sumInsured)=> sumInsured === element.value)
         - do nothing
        - else
         - ID.remove(element.index)
    - 
    

    Object.keys(option).forEach((ele)=>{console.log(option[ele].value)})





Asset insurance error:
1. The asset insurance total is added to the main total 
2. The asset insurance value is removed or modified, it does not reflect in the main total. 
3. On removal of assetInsurance make subtraction to total and grandTotal or call the calcualtion ().

- I'm now creating a product in the chosenProductsMap when the plan is selected 
    - the idea is that this will allow us to create this element at a different time than when the asset cost is edited.
