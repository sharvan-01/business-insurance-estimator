What should the sharableURL file do?

1. Strip the URL for an id attribute
    - - export the estimateExists varaible to index.js
2. If ID exists
    - go do a GET statement from the database and get the record
    - also GET the identifier to update the URL field once again (or) save the URL along with the other data 
    - also GET hs_id so that we can update values incase they change
    - do not create a HS record
    - do not create a new dB record
    - 
3. With the retrieved values then fill in the input fields
4. Click the continue buttons at each stage
    - this will trigger the respective functions for each stage in the index.js file
    - do not create a new HS record
5. Click the fourth submit button after that. 

The (fouth-continue-button).onClick function on the sharableURL.js file getting triggered
before the index.js files function is getting triggered. 




How to show options based on the available SI's for a praticular product?
- For each industry, each product has it's own SI 
- We will need to read the Json for each product, get the SI, 

- Get the SELECT field, store in an ID. 
- ID.options gives you an object with each option
    - forEach of ID.options 
        - if (fundingJSON.find(sumInsured)=> sumInsured === element.value)
         - do nothing
        - else
         - ID.remove(element.index)
