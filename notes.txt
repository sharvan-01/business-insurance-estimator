What should the sharableURL file do?

1. Strip the URL for an id attribute
    - - export the estimateExists varaible to index.js
2. If ID exists
    - go do a GET statement from the database and get the record
    - also GET the identifier to update the URL field once again (or) save the URL along with the other data 
    - also GET hs_id so that we can update values incase they change
    - do not create a HS record
    - do not create a new dB record
    - 
3. With the retrieved values then fill in the input fields
4. Click the continue buttons at each stage
    - this will trigger the respective functions for each stage in the index.js file
    - do not create a new HS record
5. 

Click the fourth submit button after that.
